# HF Check-In Tracker

This Userscript will create an alert when Stanley posts a new Check-In thread in the [Hack Forums Lounge](https://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=25). The point of this script is to remind you to check-in towards the [Everyday Ninja](https://hackforums.net/myawards.php?awid=131) award.
